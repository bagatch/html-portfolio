<h3>The Siege of Jadotville</h3>
<p>The Siege of Jadotville just brings a very overlooked story to the main screen. Filled with interesting characters, all based upon real life people. The battle scenes are incredibly well done.
    The cinematography is just phenominal. 
</p>
<h3>Danger Close</h3>
<p>
    Another war movie that is based on the Battle of Long Tan. The Aussies were the main force depicted in this movie with some insane battle scenes and even some heart wrenching scene with some deaths of the people you grow attached to.
</p>
<h3>Immortals</h3>
<p>
    As a lover of Greek Mythology this movie is a no brainer. It is incredible. From the fighting scene to the character development from both the gods and Thesius.
