<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Brian. I'm from South Carolina, USA. I am learning how to code through Dr. Angela Yu's wonderful courses.</p>

<p>I am an avide gamer and really love to play with friends and I really want to learn how to develop my own games (that's a lot of the reason I am learning to code).</p>

<p>I am also a follower of Christ. <br>
  All glory be to God!
